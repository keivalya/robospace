// This file previously contained redundant logic for authentication, dashboard, navigation, and modal handling.
// All such logic has been modularized into robospace/js/auth.js, robospace/js/dashboard.js, and robospace/js/utils.js.
// Only keep unique or legacy code here if not present in the modularized files.

// If you need to add new global logic, prefer adding it to the appropriate file in robospace/js/.

// (File intentionally left mostly empty after deduplication.)
