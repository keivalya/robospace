            <h2>Built by roboticists, for roboticists</h2>
            <p>We've spent years fighting with ROS dependencies, waiting for real robot resets, 
               and explaining why our experiments aren't reproducible. There had to be a better way.</p>

                <h3>The problem we're solving</h3>
                <p>Every robotics researcher knows the pain: 3 days to set up a simulation environment, 
                   another week to get reinforcement learning working, and good luck sharing your setup 
                   with anyone else. Meanwhile, web developers deploy entire applications in seconds.</p>
                <p>We asked ourselves: why can't robot training be that simple?</p>

                <h3>Our approach</h3>
                <p>RoboSpace brings modern developer experience to robotics. Upload your robot model 
                   like you'd deploy to Vercel. Configure training like you'd set up a GitHub Action. 
                   Share results like you'd share a CodePen.</p>
                <p>No CUDA installation. No ROS melodic vs noetic debates. Just robotics.</p>
