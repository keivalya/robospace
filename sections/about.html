                <h3>Our approach</h3>
                <p>RoboSpace brings modern developer experience to robotics. Upload your robot model like you'd deploy to Vercel. Configure training like you'd set up a GitHub Action. Share results like you'd share a CodePen.</p>
                <p>No CUDA installation. No ROS melodic vs noetic debates. Just robotics.</p>
